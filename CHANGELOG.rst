2.1.4
    * Fix some bugs in AUR stuff
    * Add new config variables: ``AUR_PKGNAME``, ``AUR_PKGNAME_GIT``, ``AUR_GIT_PACKAGE``

2.1.3
    * Create infrastructure to update AUR packages in an Arch virtual machine (``AURvm``)
    * Fix some minor typos in ``release``

2.1.2
    * Update © dates to 2017

2.1.1
    * Fix ``commitlog`` crashing due to a regex glitch (turns out ``C(.*?)``
      will match ``Chris``; changed to ``(C[A-Z]+)``)

2.1.0
    * Get rid of ``git flow`` — users should switch their main branch to
      ``master`` and delete ``develop``. This simplifies development and
      branching for most use cases.
    * Exit on errors in ``release``

2.0.7
    * Make some minor changes to CONTRIBUTING.rst
    * Use Python 3.5 in Travis

    * Use repo name for gettext domain
    * Experimental support for PyQt5 in ``localegen``

2.0.5
    * Put test setup in ``setup.cfg``
    * More modern ``setup.py`` (uses ``package_data`` and ``find_packages()``, does not use
      ``requirements.txt``, removes support for ``./setup.py test``)
    * Sample hook for AUR updates
    * Fixes to tests and ``localegen``
    * Move Qt addons to ``pypt-extras/`` directory

2.0.4
    * Split out wildcard removal that may fail so that other cleanup works fine
    * Don’t remove the ``dist`` directory

2.0.3
    * Update dates to 2016

2.0.2
    * Add ``post-release.hook`` (at the very end, perfect for “Next steps” messages)

2.0.1
    * ``MAINFEST.in`` file
    * Minor bugfixes

2.0.0
    * Automation (using cookiecutter)

1.3.1

    * Print correct release URL (``html_url`` for friendly webpage)
    * Support Transifex in locale generation (``-tx`` suffix)


1.1.0
    * Automate GitHub Releases posting. (For CMFN-based files, ``backticks`` are automatically corrected.)
