Requirements
============

Python Project Template is made possible by `Cookiecutter
<https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_. To use the template, you will
also need:

* ``zsh`` installed (required by ``/release`` and ``/.pypt/localegen`` scripts)
* Python with ``requests`` (required by ``/.pypt/{commitlog,ghrel}``) installed, as well as ``pytest``, ``coverage`` and ``pytest-cov`` — run ``pip
  install -r requirements.txt`` to install everything
* A place to host Git repositories. GitHub is assumed, but can be changed
  (documented below)
* PGP/GPG setup (for signing release commits and tags)

Template contents
=================

The template contains the following files to get you started:

* pre-configured Sphinx with:

  * ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` guide (shown by GitHub when sending a pull request or an issue)
  * ``LICENSE.rst``
  * an empty ``CHANGELOG.rst``
  * ``README.rst``
  * a bare-bones ``index.rst`` page

* The exact same files in ``/``, which are fragile and **MAY NOT** be modified
  as they are replaced with copies in ``/docs`` by the ``release`` script
* ``__init__.py``, ``__main__.py`` and ``template.py`` files in the Python package directory
* A ``setup.py`` file that could be good enough for people, and that supports
  ``entry_points`` (see https://go.chriswarrick.com/entry_points).
* ``tests/`` containing some *Is My Python Sane?*-style tests (using ``pytest``)
* An automated global update script (``.pypt/PYPT-UPDATE``)
* Entry points configuration ready to be uncommented (and a matching
  ``__main__.py`` file)
* Add-ons for Qt users (in ``pypt-extras/Qt``)
* A state-of-the-art ``release`` script, the operations of which are:

  * querying the user for version number, commit message and changes
  * updating ``/docs/CHANGELOG.rst``
  * bumping the version number in all the files, changing dates where necessary
  * copying over ``/docs/README.rst``,  ``/docs/CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``/docs/CONTRIBUTING.rst`` to ``/``
  * locale generation (via the ``.pypt/localegen`` script)
  * running ``import $PROJECTLC`` and the test suite
  * uploading a source distribution and a wheel to PyPI
  * Making a Git commit and tagging the release
  * creating a GitHub Releases entry
  * updating the AUR packages (by using hooks)

Caveats and optional features
=============================

AUR support (hooks, VM automation)
----------------------------------

This template includes full support for creating and updating AUR PKGBUILDs.
Templates for stable and git packages are in the project directory.
Furthermore, there are scripts to facilitate updating AUR packages. Those are:

* /pypt-extras/AUR/hooks/post-release.hook
* /pypt-extras/AUR/AURvm/aurvm_client.py
* /pypt-extras/AUR/AURvm/aurvm_host.py
* /pypt-extras/AUR/AURvm/aurvm_heartbeat.sh

If you want to use those, copy (move) ``post-release.hook`` to
``.pypt/hooks/post-release.hook``. If you are doing releases on an Arch Linux
system, you may want to switch the default from remote to local updates.  If
you are doing releases on any other Linux/\*nix system, you also need to copy
the entire AURvm directory to ``.pypt/``, and put ``aurvm_host.py`` and
``aurvm_heartbeat.sh`` in your ``aur-pkgbuilds`` directory.

The scripts assume a very specific setup, which is as follows:

* repos for AUR packages in ``~/git/aur-pkgbuilds``
* ``UPDATE-REQUIREMENTS.py`` and ``aur.zsh`` scripts (see `Kwpolska/aur-pkgbuilds <https://github.com/Kwpolska/aur-pkgbuilds>`_)
* An Arch Linux virtual machine that is accessible using ``ssh arch`` (in ``.ssh/config``)
* Probably some others. Those were written with only one use case in mind
  (mine, unsurprisingly).

Qt support (locales, resources)
-------------------------------

If you are using PyQt or PySide, make sure to put your UI code in a
``ui`` submodule.  Copy the ``pypt-extras/Qt/resources.py`` file to that
submodule, even if you are not using resources now. Make sure to create a
``.pro`` file with your sources and locales.

If you do not want to use GitHub
--------------------------------

Search for mentions of GitHub (case-insensitively) and remove them. They
appear in some auto-generated links, for example.  The ``release`` script
assumes GitHub Releases, you can remove that part.

If you do not want to publish to the Arch User Repository
---------------------------------------------------------

Remove ``PKGBUILD``, ``PKGBUILD-git``. Set ``aur_email`` to anything.

If you do not want to use Travis CI
-----------------------------------

Remove ``.travis.yml`` and the badge in README files.

Getting started
===============

One time setup: virtualenvs and project directory
-------------------------------------------------

If you don’t know how virtualenvs work and why you should use them, read `my guide about setting up a Python development environment <https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2017/07/03/setting-up-a-python-development-environment/#installing-packages>`_.

You will need to prepare two places:

1. A place where you store your projects (git repositories). You probably have
   a folder for that already; if you don’t, use ``~/Projects`` or ``~/git``.
2. Somewhere to store virtualenvs. Using virtualenvwrapper is recommended, but
   not necessary. Don’t put your virtualenvs next to your code.

Create a virtualenv for PyPT named ``cookiecutter``. Clone the PyPT GitHub
repository to your project space. Run ``pip install -r
python-project-template/requirements.txt`` to install PyPT’s requirements to
your environment.

Starting a new project
----------------------

Activate the ``cookiecutter`` virtualenv. While in your project home, run
``cookiecutter python-project-template`` and answer the questions.
(If ``aur_email`` and ``github_username`` don’t apply, set them to anything.)

The script can optionally create an entry point to start your app from command
line. Select ``cli`` or ``gui`` if you want one. Select ``none`` otherwise. If
you don’t know why you would want one, read `my guide about entry_points <https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2014/09/15/python-apps-the-right-way-entry_points-and-scripts/>`_.

Fixing the things that cannot be automated
------------------------------------------

* You need to modify all documents that are stored in ``docs/``. Some of them
   need reST syntax fixes (title underlines). README needs real content.
* Since your first commit will **not** use the ``release`` script, you need to copy files by hand:

   1. ``/docs/README.rst`` to ``/README.rst`` and ``/README``
   2. ``/docs/CHANGELOG.rst`` to ``/CHANGELOG.rst``

* Modify ``/.pypt/config``. Verify that all settings are correct.
* If you’re using GitHub, generate a `GitHub Personal Access Token
  <https://github.com/settings/tokens>`_ in the ``repo`` scope and write it to a ``/.pypt/gh-token`` file. You may reuse tokens between different repos running PyPT. (This is used for automating GitHub Releases.)

Preparing code
--------------

* If you have any code, you can put it in your package already. Use
  ``template.py`` as a template for your Python files. (Remove it if you don’t
  need it, or store it somewhere else.)
* Customize ``/setup.py`` to your liking.  You should pay attention to the classifiers, requirements, and other things you desire to change.
* If you enabled entry points, edit ``__main__.py``. Remember that ``main()`` must take no
  positional/non-default arguments! If you do not want to create scripts and
  don’t want command-line interfaces, remove ``__main__.py``.
* Create a virtual environment for your project. Make sure to install
  ``requirements.txt``.

Extras
------

If you want to use AUR or Qt extras, check out the documentation (`Caveats and optional features`_).
Remove the ``pypt-extras`` directory if you don’t need anything else from it.

If you have a ``PYPT-UPDATE`` script, add your new project to the list there. If not, you may want to copy it from the repository root and set it up.

Your first commit
-----------------

Run the following commands (assumes GitHub)::

    source .pypt/config
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:$GITUSER/$GITREPO
    git add .
    git commit -sm 'initial commit via @Kwpolska’s Python Project Template'
    git push -u origin master

Congratulations!

If you’re ready to make your first release
------------------------------------------

Run ``./release`` and watch magic happen. Make sure your project virtualenv is
active.

But if this is your first project, you should check if:

* GPG works on your system
* you created the virtualenv with the Python version, installed requirements
  and have activated it
* git works, and you have a GitHub access token (if desired)
* the optional features are configured properly
